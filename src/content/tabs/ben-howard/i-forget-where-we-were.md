## Lyrics

Hey, I wasn't listening  
I was watching Syria blinded by the sunshine strip  
You, you were in the kitchen  
Oh your mariner's mouth, the wounded with the wounder's whip

And that's how summer passed  
Oh the great dividing range  
The green, green grass and oh  
Maybe it was peace at last, who knew

Hello love, my invincible friend  
Hello love, the thistle and the burr  
Hello love, for you, I have so many words

But I, I forget where we were  
I forget where we were

Hey, I wasn't listening  
I was stung by all of us, the blind leading out the bored  
And as per usual, you were  
Skipping and laughing eyes at the bedroom door  
"Don't take it so seriously, no  
Only time is ours, the rest we'll just wait and see"  
Maybe you're right babe, maybe

Hello love, my invincible friend  
Hello love, the thistle and the burr  
Hello love, for you, I have so many words

But I, I forget where we were  
I, I forget where we were  
I, I forget where we were  
I forget where we were  
I forget where we were  
I forget where we were
